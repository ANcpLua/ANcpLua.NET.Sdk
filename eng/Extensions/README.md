# Extensions

This directory contains various extensions that provide utility functions or enhance existing functionalities across the ANcpLua.NET.Sdk.

To include these extensions or specific features within your project, you can use the following XML properties in your `.csproj` file.

## General Extensions Configuration

To enable general extensions:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <EnableANcpLuaExtensions>true</EnableANcpLuaExtensions>
</PropertyGroup>
```

Individual sub-extensions might have their own specific properties for finer-grained control.
